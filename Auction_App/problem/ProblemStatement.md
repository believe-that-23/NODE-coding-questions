## Title: 
Real-time Auction Web Application

### Introduction:
Your task is to build a real-time auction web application that allows users to create and participate in auctions. Users can post items for auction with starting prices and durations, place bids on active auctions, and view auction details in real-time. The application uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for the server, and WebSocket for real-time communication with clients.

### Objectives:

1. Database Integration:
- Implement MongoDB integration to store auction data.

2. Create an Auction:
- Develop postItemForAuction to let users post items for auction.
- Store auction details in MongoDB using saveAuctionToDatabase.
- Ensure that only one auction can be active at a given time, preventing simultaneous auctions.

3. Real-time Bidding:
- Use WebSocket for real-time updates between clients and the server.
- Implement placeBid for users to bid on auctions.
- Update price and owner in real-time.
- Emit 'placeBid' to the server with bid amount and username.
- Handle 'placeBid' on the server with placeBidOnAuction, validate, and update auctions.
- Emit 'bidPlaced' with updated details.

4. Auction Timer:
- Create startAuctionTimer for countdown.
- Display time left on the client side.

5. Handle Auction Ending:
- Notify 'auctionEnded' when an auction ends.
- Display winning bidder and price.

6. User Interaction:
- Let users provide and validate usernames with validateUsername.


7. Client-Side Interface:
- Design a user-friendly client interface.
- Display real-time auction information.
